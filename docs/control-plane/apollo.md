# Ctrip Apollo
[Ctrip Apollo](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo) is a Configuration Server which can be used to store your configurations. Go-Chassis supports retrieving the configurations from Apollo and can be used for dynamic configurations of microservices. In this guide we will explain you how to configure Go-Chassis to use Apollo as a configuration server.

## Configurations
Use can use this [guide](https://github.com/ctripcorp/apollo/wiki) to start up the Ctrip Apollo and make the Project, NamesSpace and add Configurations to it. Once your Apollo Server is setup then you can do the following modification in Go-Chassis to make it work with Apollo.  
Update the chassis.yaml of your microservices with the following configuration.
```yaml
servicecomb:
  config:
    client:
      serverUri: http://127.0.0.1:8080          # This should be the address of your Apollo Server
      type: apollo                              # The type should be Apollo
      refreshInterval: 10                       # Chassis retrieves the configurations from Apollo at this interval
      serviceName: apollo-chassis-demo          # This the name of the project in Apollo Server
      env: DEV                                  # This is the name of environment to which configurations belong in Apollo
      cluster: demo                             # This is the name of cluster to which your Project belongs in Apollo
      namespace: application                    # This is the NameSpace to which your configurations belong in the project.
```
Once these configurations are set the Chassis can retrieve the configurations from Apollo Server.
